## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- A11y-slider

### What I learned

I learned it is a lot easier to make a full page slider with html, css and js and make it responsive than a multi image slider. I went with A11y-Silder as it worked for what I needed the carousel to do. I didn't include the buttons, but used a scroll bar.

### Continued development
I would like to work on grid css and flexbox.
